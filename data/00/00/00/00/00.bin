它们不仅仅是线性的
It's more than a linear path.

13
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,560
而是一个拥有无限可能的棱镜
It's a prism of endless possibility.

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,520
一个选择便能开辟出无数个现实
Where a single choice can branch out into infinite realities,

15
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,000
创造出与你所知不同的平行世界
creating alternate worlds from the ones you know.

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,280
我是观察者

"假如"呢
"What if?"

22
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,260
每段旅程都有起点
Every journey has a beginning,

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,990
但途中哪怕只改变一步
but change one step along the way,

24
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,150
你可能会到达完全不同的终点
and you could end up at a very different destination.

25
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,170
{\an8}阿富汗  库纳尔省

26
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,030
好啦  笑笑嘛  没事的
Come on. It's okay. Laugh.

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,900
我可以跟您合个影吗
Is it cool if I take a picture with you?

28
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,690
非常可以  别比黑帮手势
Yes, it's very cool. Please, no gang signs.

29
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,320
开玩笑的  举起来吧
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

30
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,650
和平  我爱和平  要是和平了我就没生意了
Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace.

- Wait, wait, wait. Give me a gun. - Stay here.

That was a spectacular entrance, seriously.

36
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,040
十戒组织的援军快来了  我们得赶紧走
The Ten Rings have reinforcements en route. We need to move, now.

37
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,050
没问题  杀人魔头中尉
Fine by me, Lieutenant Killmonger?

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,550
{\an8}杀人魔头

39
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,820
-这是德语吗  -是外号
- What is that? German? - A nickname.

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,700
真适合你  我看出来了
That's clearly a good fit. I see where they got it.

41
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,680
你今天下午有什么安排
Uh, what's your afternoon like?

42
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,590
没人生来就是英雄  英雄是在黑暗中铸就的
Heroes are not born, they're forged in darkness.

43
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,890
在战争中锻造
Shaped in battle.

44
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,790
以牺牲来定义
Defined by sacrifice.

45
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,040
我就是钢铁侠
And I am Iron Man.

46
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,770
没有托尼·斯塔克在阿富汗命定被俘
Without Tony Stark's fateful capture in Afghanistan,

47
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,460
钢铁侠时代就永远不会到来
the Age of Iron Man would never come to pass.

48
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,900
虽然他被救下  但英雄不复存在了
Though the man was saved, a hero was lost,

49
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,220
恶人得到了新的机会
and a villain was given a new chance.

50
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,000
斯塔克先生  你在袭击中受伤了吗
Mr. Stark, were you injured in the attack?

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,060
没有  但我的酒洒了  那可是1926年麦卡伦威士忌
No, but I did spill my drink, and it was a '26 Macallan,

52
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,550
所以我十分确定那是战争罪
so I'm pretty sure that's a war crime.

53
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,020
不好意思先生  我是《英国邮报》的哈里·惠廷顿
Excuse me, sir. Harry Whittington, British Post.

54
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,320
你去阿富汗这次有没有学到什么
Did you learn any lessons from your time in Afghanistan?

55
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,770
有  没有四季酒店的地方一律别去
I did. Never travel anywhere that doesn't have a Four Seasons.

56
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,580
斯塔克先生  这次经历有没有改变你
Mr. Stark, has this experience changed you?

57
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,030
我看到了年轻的美国人被杀
Well, I saw young Americans killed

58
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,820
杀害他们的正是我为了维护他们而制造的武器
by the very weapons I created to protect them.

59
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,020
我意识到我们得做得更好
And I realized we have to do better,

60
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,270
造更强的武器  为了他们更拼命地战斗
build bigger, and fight badder for them.

61
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,470
所以我要让埃里克·斯蒂文斯
Which is why I'm bringing in Lieutenant Erik Stevens,

62
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,140
这位救了我一命的海豹突击队队员
the Navy SEAL who saved my life,

63
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,900
担任斯塔克工业的新首席安全官
as Stark Industries' new chief security officer.

64
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,770
真扯淡  这职位本来应该是我的
This such a load of bull. That was supposed to be my promotion.

65
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,830
好了  托尼回来了
All right! Tony's back, huh?

66
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,840
中尉  中尉  我是克莉丝汀·艾凡哈特
Lieutenant. Lieutenant. Christine Everhart.

67
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,170
提问环节结束了
I think we're done here.

68
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,390
你当时在库纳尔省干什么
What is it you were doing in the Kunar province?

69
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,710
救我啊  我们肯定说过了
Uh, saving me. Pretty sure we went over this.

70
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,090
很奇怪  因为袭击那天
It's just strange. Since on the day of the attack,

71
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,570
他的部队驻扎在400千米之外
his unit was stationed 400 klicks away.

72
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,390
你想说的是
If you're trying to imply

73
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,730
他之前就知道要发生袭击
that he had advanced knowledge of the attack...

74
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,250
她说得对  我某次在十戒组织卧底时
She'd be right. I uncovered plans to assassinate Tony Stark

75
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,640
发现了刺杀托尼·斯塔克的计划
while on a deep cover operation inside the Ten Rings.

76
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,610
这下你们满意了
Well, there you have it, folks.

77
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,010
这件事谈到这就结束了
That's going to be a wrap on this conversation.

78
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,990
是啊  你巴不得结束呢  对吧
Yeah. Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

79
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,860
因为这些计划都是由斯塔克工业的
Because those plans were

80
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,320
首席运营官奥巴代亚·斯坦尼资助的
bankrolled by Stark Industry COO Obadiah Stane.

81
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,620
托尼  我
Tony, I...

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,730
我不知道这孩子在说什么
I don't know what this kid's talking about.

83
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,900
我们赶紧先离开这里再聊这件事
Let's get outta here and work through this.

84
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,900
不  不用你操心了  我把收据都带来了
No, no, don't you worry about that. I brought receipts.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,910
电子转账  银行文件  电话记录
Wire transfers, bank documents, phone records.

86
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,020
上网查吧  我都放到网上去了
Google it. I just dropped it all online.

87
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,570
我就知道
I knew it.

88
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,670
托尼
Tony...

89
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,290
你这该死的  保安
You son of a... Security!

90
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,580
天啊
Oh, man.

91
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,910
我本来就一直不喜欢这家伙
Ah. I never liked that guy.

92
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,150
我要对新来的这位说
I'll say this for the new guy,

93
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,260
他很适合上电视  对不对
he certainly makes for good TV. Right?

94
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,240
恐怖分子  企业掠夺者
Terrorists, corporate raiders,

95
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,390
《马克西姆》杂志的封面模特
Maxim cover models.

96
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,040
他们有什么共同点
What do they all have in common?

97
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,520
-他们都为王者而来  -而且都没得手
- They came for the king. - And they missed.

98
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,580
我欠了你很多
I owe it all to you.

99
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,600
所以我想让你做我新的首席运营官
And that's why I want you by my side

100
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,790
全天候寸步不离
24-7 as my new COO.

101
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,780
等等  你要给他奥巴代亚的工作
Wait. You're giving him Obadiah's job?

102
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,380
我说不好  斯塔克先生  我是个兵
Damn, I don't know, Mr. Stark. I think I'm more of a soldier.

103
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,500
这才完美呢
Which is why it's perfect.

104
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,050
你和我一起  我们就像神枪手与智多星
You, me. We'll be like Butch and Sundance.

105
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,530
托尼  他们最后都死了
They died at the end, Tony.

106
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,700
好吧  例子举得不好
Okay, bad example.

107
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,870
事实是我需要一个致命杀手  这当然只是比喻
Fact remains, I need a killer. Figurative one, of course.

108
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,490
不过字面意思上的杀手也不赖
But, hey, a literal one can't hurt either.

109
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,100
-敬杀手  -没错
- To killers. - Yeah.

110
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,610
事先说好  你当神枪手  我是智多星
You're Butch. I'm Sundance. Just so we're clear.

111
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,210
罗德中校  你对这位身着闪亮盔甲的骑士
So, Colonel Rhodes, what can you tell me

112
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,460
都查到了些什么
about our knight in shining camouflage?

113
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,700
19岁从安纳波利斯毕业
Graduated Annapolis at 19,

114
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,250
一年后硕士毕业于麻省理工
MIT a year later.

115
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,510
自从加入海豹突击队成为精英幽灵小队一员后
Made quite a name for himself since joining the SEALs

116
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,950
因为专门执行高级目标任务
as part of an elite ghost squad

117
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,400
而有不小的名气
that specializes in high-target wetwork.

118
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,520
-千万是清理水管的任务  -暗杀任务
- Please tell me that's plumbing. - Assassinations.

119
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,460
老天  幸好我确认了一下
Jeez. Glad I asked for clarification.

120
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,900
作为一个来自奥克兰的孩子  他真得很棒
I'd say he's done pretty good for a kid from Oakland.

121
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,110
派珀  你到底在担心什么
I mean, what's your concern, Pepper?

122
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,010
除了要杀人的勾当以外
Other than the killing part.

123
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,590
很多人会想要凑上来
Lot of people come around looking

124
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,750
跟托尼·斯塔克拉上关系
to get their moment in the sun with Tony Stark,

125
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,510
而我的工作就是要弄清楚
and it's my job to sniff out exactly

126
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,620
他们到底想从他这里得到什么
what it is they want with him.

127
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,260
-那你发现什么了  -什么也没有
- And what do you smell? - Nothing.

128
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,240
这样才奇怪  每个人都是有目的的
And that's the problem. Everyone wants something.

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,450
欢迎来到糖果乐园
Welcome to Candy Land.

130
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,190
这里的东西都是我亲手造的
I built everything in here myself.

131
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,600
除了兰博基尼  那是3D打印出来的
Well, except for the Lambo. That's 3D printed.

132
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,010
我的天  冲击技术
Oh, man. Repulsor tech?

133
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,800
我在试着把耶利哥导弹缩小成为便携武器
Trying to miniaturize the Jericho into a portable firearm.

134
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,090
肯定酷毙了
Bet she pops.

135
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,310
放松  杀手  我为和平而来
Easy, killer. I come in peace.

136
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,620
你父亲以前怎么说的来着  对了
What did your old man used to say? Ah. That's right.

137
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,320
"和平就是比对方的棍子大"
"Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."

138
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,320
友善点  他是我的朋友
Hey, play nice. He's a friend.

139
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,090
我老爸做了不少好事  你呢
Lot of good it did dear old Dad. What about you?

140
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,110
-你和你父亲关系好吗  -不
- You close with yours? - Nah.

141
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,830
他也去世了  帮派火并
He died, too. Gang violence.

142
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,360
武器落入错误的人手中
Weapons in the wrong hands.

143
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,920
希望没人再会使用它们了
Wish no one had to fire them at all.

144
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,610
确实  还有
For real. Then again...

145
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,260
-算了  -什么
- Ah, forget it. - What?

146
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,000
就是我的博士论文
It's just my doctoral thesis.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,350
我设计了一架自动战斗无人机
I developed plans for an automated combat drone.

148
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,700
我认为这样就能取代人类士兵了
Thought I was going to make human soldiers obsolete.

149
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,270
但我一直没机会深入研究
But I could never crack the interface.

150
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,760
因为以前你没有我  我们一起做吧
'Cause you didn't have me. Let's do this.

151
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,480
我们一起完成你的科学展览项目
Let's build your science fair project.

152
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,890
你救了我的命  我想还你人情
You saved my life. I'd like to return the favor.

153
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,210
贾维斯  搜索一下麻省理工学院博士论文数据库
Jarvis, search the MIT doctoral thesis database.

154
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,680
-项目叫  -解放者
- Project... - Liberator.

155
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,630
不得不说  你还挺会取名字
You've got an ear for branding. I'll give you that.

156
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,890
这设计可真大胆
Wow. Uh, bold design choice.

157
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,450
怎么了  我喜欢日漫
What? I like anime.

158
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,540
最坏的结局  也不过是
Worst-case scenario, we'll

159
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,960
造了一个世界最贵的高达手办
end up with the world's most expensive Gundam model.

160
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,520
贾维斯  搜索一下仓库
Jarvis, case the warehouse.

161
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,360
我们需要FPV接线  纳米电路
We're gonna need FPV wiring, nanocircuitry,

162
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,930
再来几杯血腥玛丽  宿醉上头了
and Bloody Marys. Hangover's starting to kick in.

163
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,340
人类操作难免出差错  但在贾维斯掌控下
Human pilots mean human error, but with Jarvis at the wheel,

164
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,530
无人机甲就可实时同步
drones can react to stimuli

165
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,050
而不用我们动一根指头
in real-time and no one needs to lift a finger.

166
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,790
操作测试
Operations test. 

167
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,080
斯塔克解放者无人机甲就位  开始行动
Stark Liberator drone mark one, showtime.

168
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,750
爆炸了才算失败
It's only a failure if it explodes.

169
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,790
好吧  当我没说
Okay, that changes things.

170
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,330
看样子无人机的调节器运行频率过快
It appears the drone's regulating processor is over-clocked.

171
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,760
我们还需要一个电源
You know, we need another power source.

172
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,750
有了  可以做个微型反应堆
Hey. Hey. If we could miniaturize an arc reactor...

173
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,930
-不行  不太现实  -我们只需要振金
- No, that's a dumb idea. - What we need is Vibranium.

174
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,680
合理的改进
With the right juice,

175
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,720
能让它变成一种自我再生能源
it can act as a self-sustaining energy source.

176
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,420
没错  想法不错
Yeah. Now you're thinking.

177
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,740
只是不巧  以前打仗都被用光了
Too bad Pops used up the last of it during the war.

178
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,680
没全用光
Hmm. Not all of it.

179
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,580
你这是从哪搞来的
Where did you get this?

180
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,010
只要你有点门路
This kind of stuff pops up all over the globe.

181
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,270
这东西全球都能找到
You need the right hook up.

182
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,850
我还真能找出个人来
I might have just the guy.

183
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,220
尤利西斯·克劳  不行  托尼  坚决不行
Ulysses Klaue? No, Tony. Absolutely not.

184
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,550
你有资格对我这种缴税等级的人说这种话吗
Are you allowed to say that to people in my tax bracket?

185
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,990
托尼  你别忘了
Tony, in case you forgot,

186
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,840
斯塔克工业绝不与
Stark Industries doesn't

187
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,380
黑市军火商做交易
fraternize with black market arms dealers.

188
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,750
她说得对  托尼  我也同意
She's right, Tony. I agree. 

189
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,440
慢着  什么
Wait. What?

190
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,800
要是东窗事发  股东们就会撤资
Things go south, shareholders are gonna flip.

191
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,650
除非拿外交打掩护
Unless we secure some kind of diplomatic cover.

192
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,770
派罗德去  好了  他是美国空军
We send Rhodey. There. He's U.S. Air Force,

193
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,850
公司军事顾问  我们完全摘出来了
and he's the company's military liaison. We are all aboveboard.

194
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,410
这是个好主意
I think that's a great idea.

195
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,890
很好  说定了  派珀  下采购订单
Excellent. I's dotted, T's crossed. Pep, drop the purchase order.

196
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,100

非洲沿岸

197
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,240
实属罕见啊
Break out the fine China.

198
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,640
美国人怎么来找
Not every day the Americans

199
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,890
我这种人做交易
get down in the muck with the likes of me.

200
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,370
想要世界变好  必要时就得脏手
Can't clean up the world without getting your hands dirty.

201
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,520
说得好  可以缝在枕头上当警句了
Oh! That is good. You should stitch that on a pillow.

202
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,940
这家伙可真啰嗦
Ugh! This guy will run his mouth all day.

203
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,240
告诉他你想验货
Tell him you want to see the product.

204
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,870
那振金在哪呢
So, about that Vibranium?

205
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,270
不要前戏  直切主题啊
Oh. Oh. No foreplay, eh?

206
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,140
也好  反正也是浪费时间
You know what? It's a waste of time anyway.

207
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,900
朵拉护卫队振金长矛
Dora Milaje spear.

208
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,460
黑市上花一千万买的  非常贵  不过
Bought it off the black market for ten mil. Steep, I know. But...

209
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,000
拜托  托尼在维加斯大手一挥一千万就出去了
Please, Tony spends $10 million on a slow Tuesday in Vegas.

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,930
很好
Good.

211
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,400
看来你是来真的
Now that I know you mean business,

212
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,350
那我就给你看点好东西
we can move on to the good stuff.

213
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,290
你从哪搞来这些的
Where did you find all this?

214
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,530
什么情况  有人闯入
What's going on here? We've been breached.

215
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,160
找到他们  锁定对方
Find them and light them up.

216
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,460
克尔芒戈  你看到敌人了吗  克尔芒戈
Killmonger, you got eyes on this? Killmonger!

217
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,890
四区呼叫一区
Sector four to sector one.

218
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,990
四区呼叫一区
Sector four to sector one.

219
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,080
克尔芒戈  回话  你看到什么了
Killmonger, on comms. Are you seeing this?

220
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,430
这场冲突与你无关  上校
Our quarrel is not with you, Colonel.

221
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,840
是吗  我怎么不这么觉着
Oh, really? 'Cause you're sending me mixed messages.

222
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,430
我只想把振金带回其所属之地
Let me take the Vibranium back where it belongs.

223
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,570
不好意思  因为那是不可能的
Sorry, cuz. That's ain't gonna fly.

224
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,680
真希望我们不需要走到这个境地
Really wish it didn't have to go down like this.

225
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,070
斯塔克的研发部真厉害  这声波电击枪真好用
Stark R and D is no joke. The sonic taser thing is legit.

226
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,240
但是这个...
But this...

227
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,870
-这个才是我真正想要的  -艾瑞克  为什么
- This I'm really feeling. - Erik, why?

228
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,520
更好的问题  为什么要给你的压迫者当兵
Better question. Why wear the uniform of your own oppressors?

229
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,000
替他们战斗  替他们死
Fight for them? Die for them?

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,810
孩子  想要改变系统  必须先成为系统的一部分
Kid, you've gotta be part of the system to change the system.

231
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,130
不  你可以把他们整个摧毁
Nah. You can burn it down.

232
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,470
哎呦  我可不会想和你这种人下象棋  我的朋友
My, my, my. I would not want to play chess with you, my friend.

233
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,280
我把交易的消息放给瓦坎达战士
I leaked word of the sale to the Wakandan War Dogs.

234
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,770
然后事情的发展和你预期的一样
And it all played out just as you predicted it would.

235
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,510
赶紧装货  朵拉快来了
We better load up the product. The Dora'll be here soon.

236
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:59,660
我们不能眼睁睁的看着我们的资源被掠夺
T'We will not sit idly by while our resources are pillaged,

237
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,770
看着我们的人民被美帝国主义者杀害
our people killed at the hands of American imperialists.

238
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,210
托尼  给你带了个纪念品
Hey, Tony. Brought you a souvenir.

239
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,250
怎么  机场礼品店的三角巧克力卖光了吗
What, airport gift shop out of Toblerones?

240
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,810
这么说你看过新闻了
So you've been watching the news?

241
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,710
我们损失了一个人  让全世界看看谁才是老大
We lost one of our own. Let's show the world who's boss.

242
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,080
那到底谁是老大呢  中尉
And just who is the boss, Lieutenant?

243
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,300
据我所知  你的名字挂在大楼外面
Last I checked, your name's on the building.

244
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,890
还出现在各种文件里  这都是你计划好的
And the paper trail. You certainly saw to that.

245
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,020
但你并没有考虑周全
But not to everything.

246
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,650
记住一点  不要跟贾维斯玩找线索游戏  他洞悉一切
Word to the wise. Never play Clue with Jarvis. He sees all.

247
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,240
来啊  报警啊
Go ahead, call the cops.

248
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,910
他们没法及时赶到来救你的
Still won't get here in time to save you.

249
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,680
警察只代表法律  我要的是正义
Yeah, well, police are the law. I want justice.

250
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,580
你吗  你这辈子一点重活都没干过
You? You never lifted a finger in your life.

251
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,380
你打算喊派珀来杀死我吗
You gonna ask Pepper to come and kill me?

252
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,220
应该不用  而且也没必要
Yeah, probably not. But there's no need.

253
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,220
我把你的戒指融了
I melted down that ring of yours.

254
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,090
你说得没错  振金确实好用
You were right. Vibranium worked like a charm.

255
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,400
怎么说  敬杀手
What do you say? To killers?

256
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,810
他清楚你的招数  没错吧
Whoa, he's got your number, am I right?

257
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,990
你忘了是你给无人机编程的
You forget you programmed the drone yourself?

258
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,770
你的招数就是他的招数
Your moves are his moves.

259
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,830
看来我只好自由发挥了
I guess I have to freestyle, then.

260
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,100
每一道代表我杀死的一个人  信不信由你  托尼
Each one is for a kill. Believe it or not, Tony,

261
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,710
我本来真心希望不会轮到你
I was really hoping you wouldn't make the cut.

262
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,090
曾几何时
For a minute, 

263
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,540
我还以为是咱们两个一起对抗全世界 
I really thought it was you and me against the world.

264
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,280
我们不是为了同一个目标战斗  托尼
We're not fighting the same battles, Tony.

265
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,080
两个计算机迷试图替父辈做正确的事
Two gear-head orphans trying to do right by our fathers?

266
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,680
我觉得我们差不多
We sound the same to me.

267
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,440
我们两个的区别在于...
The difference between you and me...

268
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,010
你看不出来我们两个的区别在哪
...is that you can't see the difference between you and me.

269
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,520
振金矛  瓦坎达出品  绝对是暗杀
Vibranium spear. Wakandan issue. Definite hit job.

270
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,010
是瓦坎达人想杀鸡儆猴
The Wakandans sent a message.

271
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,500
这已经是明目张胆了
Not a very subtle one.

272
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,380
为什么监控录像没有拍到
How did none of this get captured on security?

273
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,490
贾维斯被清空了  非常巧合
Jarvis was wiped clean. Conveniently.

274
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,950
你想暗示什么  派珀
What are you implying, Pepper?

275
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,790
我不知道  两天以内出现三起谋杀
I don't know, three murders in two days,

276
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,970
都和一个人有关
and one man at the center?

277
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,360
他是一位海军高级官员
You are talking to a highly decorated Naval officer.

278
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,750
没关系  将军  别太责怪这位女士
It's cool, General. Cut the lady some slack.

279
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,900
她和托尼关系很好
Her and Tony were tight.

280
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,060
下一步是什么
What's the next move?

281
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,080
他们想要战争  那就给他们战争
They want a war, so that's what we'll give 'em.

282
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,830
安排解放者无人机投产
Put the Liberator drones into production.

283
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:11,200
等一下  这需要调动几十亿的资金
Okay, hold on. That'll require a multi-billion-dollar allocation.

284
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,640
必须通过董事会
The board will need to be consulted.

285
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,500
爱国者法案可以免去这些繁文缛节
The Patriot Act should cover the red tape.

286
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,710
美国军方现在
The U.S. Military is hereby

287
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,790
扣押史塔克工业的所有资产
seizing control of all Stark Industries assets.

288
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,850
你肯定是在开玩笑
You must be joking.

289
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,630
没人觉得我有幽默感  波茨小姐
No one has ever accused me of being funny, Miss Potts.

290
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,470
我们在打仗  你现在为我工作了
We're at war. You work for me now.

291
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,990
恭喜  中尉
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

292
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,160
你刚刚发明了21世纪的战争
You just invented 21st century warfare.

293
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,050
那是
That is...

294
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,070
太棒了
Yes! Yes! Yes!

295
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,200
我很高兴看到我的振金能物尽其用
Oh, I'm glad to see my Vibranium's been put to good use.

296
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,660
我才刚开始  来趟公路旅行吧
Yeah, and I'm just getting started. How about a road trip?

297
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,930
-就是这里吗  -瓦坎达人惊喜多多
- You telling me this is it? - Wakandans are full of surprises.

298
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,390
瓦坎达
Wakanda.

299
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,200
我找到它了  爸
I found it, Dad.

300
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,970
小子  快来  我们该走了
Hey! Hey, boy! Come on. We better get going.

301
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,620
我可不想撞到他们的矛尖上
Not looking to meet the business end of one of their spears,

302
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,160
如果你知道我的意思的话
if you know what I mean.

303
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,400
野蛮人
Savages.

304
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,350
如你所说  瓦坎达人惊喜多多
It's like you said. Wakandans are full of surprises.

305
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,200
我是带着礼物而来  带来了公道
I come with a gift. An offering of justice.

306
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,950
我是尼贾达卡  尼乔布王子的儿子
For I am N'Jadaka, son of Prince N'Jobu.

307
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,730
什么乱七八糟的
What is this foolishness?

308
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,550
尼乔布没有孩子
N'Jobu sired no children!

309
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,650
那是我们误以为  是我让我们那样以为
We were led to believe that. I let us believe that.

310
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,290
我们在打仗  而他仍是美国士兵
We are at war, he is still an American soldier.

311
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,590
他了解我们人民多少
What does he know of our people?

312
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,530
他们也是我的同胞  表妹
These are my people too, cousin.

313
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,180
我把偷你们振金
I brought you the man who stole your Vibranium

314
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,320
杀你们同胞的人带来了
and murdered your people

315
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,450
作为我忠于瓦坎达的证明
as proof of my loyalty to Wakanda.

316
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,420
你有着你父亲的眼睛
You have the eyes of your father.

317
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,410
他跟我说过你的事
He used to tell me stories about you.

318
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,560
和他哥一起
About watching the sunset

319
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,660
在巴圣加山顶看日落
from the top of Mount Bashenga with his brother.

320
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:03,220
我也和我儿子说过
I shared the same story with my own son.

321
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,790
我这一生都在找我的家
I spent my whole life searching for my home.

322
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,940
放心  侄子  你到家了
Rest easy, nephew. You are home.

323
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,260
但没时间休息了  伯伯  战争要来了
But there's no time to rest, Uncle. War is here.

324
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,240
无人机是用振金合金制成
The drones are made up of Vibranium alloy.

325
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,410
就像你们的武器  几乎坚不可摧
Just like your weapons. Almost indestructible.

326
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,440
拜托  它们是美国人造的
Oh, please. They're built by Americans.

327
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,580
我们在午饭前就能解决
We'll be home in time for lunch.

328
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,550
不会那么容易
It will not be that easy.

329
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,010
无人机是通过蜂巢矩阵运行
The drones operate via a hive matrix,

330
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,700
实时互相交流
communicating with each other in real time

331
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,830
来使战略效率最大化
to maximize strategic efficiency.

332
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,240
那我们该怎么切断它们的网络
Then how do we cut them off from their network?

333
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,040
我们让它们进到我们的防护罩里
We let them inside our force shields.

334
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,640
电磁干扰会屏蔽掉它们的卫星连接
The electromagnetic interference will block their satellite uplink.

335
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,650
你想让我们让杀戮机器人进到我们的城市里来
You're suggesting we let the killer robots into the city?

336
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,320
那是唯一把它们和人工智能贾维斯断开的方法
That's the only way to disconnect them from the Jarvis AI.

337
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,020
然后  我们摧毁它们
After that, we'll destroy 'em.

338
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,450
美国人没有任何能重建的振金留存
The Americans won't have any Vibranium left to rebuild.

339
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,110
我们为何要把我们人民的性命押在你身上
Why should we trust you with our people's lives?

340
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,500
我知道亲友被夺走是何感受
I know what it's like to have someone taken from me,

341
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,020
如果我有机会为我父亲复仇  我不会犹豫
and if I had the chance to avenge my father, I wouldn't hesitate.

342
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,680
这些人谋杀了你儿子
These people murdered your son.

343
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,650
就算我说的只是可能是真的
Even if there's only a chance I'm legit,

344
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,680
难道不值得冒这个险吗
isn't it worth the risk?

345
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,230
你说呢  将军
What say you, General?

346
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,830
为了特查拉
For T'Challa!

347
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:23,830
必胜  必胜  必胜
Yibambe! Yibambe! Yibambe!

348
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,040
{\an8}无人机指挥中心  内华达州

349
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,950
报告情况  先生们
Status, gentlemen.

350
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,000
一切正常  将军  无人机正在就位
We have full systems green, General. Drones moving into position.

351
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,640
这就是瓦坎达的首都吗
This is the Wakandan capital?

352
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,830
-确认位置  -长官  所有无人机均已就位
- Confirm location. - Sir, all drones are on target.

353
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,650
是时候了
It's time.

354
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,060
你确定吗  爸爸
Are you certain about this, baba?

355
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,120
把我们的命运交到这个外人手上
Entrusting our fate to this outsider.

356
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,770
他是家人
He is family.

357
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,590
打开防护罩
Open the shields.

358
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,600
瓦坎达  所以传言都是真的
Wakanda. So the rumors are true.

359
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,930
让他们看看美国军队的真正力量
Show them the true might of the U.S. Military.

360
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:38,710
伯伯
Uncle?

361
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,480
关闭护盾
Close the shields.

362
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,580
-怎么回事  -是某种干扰
- What the hell is going on? - Some kind of interference.

363
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,730
无人机都已失联
The drones have all gone dark.

364
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,650
对  我看到了  重新上线
Yeah, I see that. Get it back online!

365
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,110
起作用了  你是对的
It's working! You were right.

366
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,750
谢谢你  我的侄子
Thank you, nephew.

367
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,900
你让你的叔叔和父亲都感到骄傲
You've made your uncle and father proud.

368
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,700
我只是想帮助瓦坎达
I only wish to serve Wakanda.

369
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,320
我更想你今晚和我一起庆祝
I'd much rather you join me in celebration tonight.

370
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,000
不管生活的旅程将你带到哪里
Know that wherever life's journey takes you,

371
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,840
瓦坎达都会是你的家
you'll always have a home in Wakanda.

372
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,090
我要的不止这些
I want a little bit more than that.

373
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,940
这不可能
That is impossible.

374
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,640
无人机应该已经失联了
The drones should be disconnected.

375
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,610
托尼·斯塔克  他肯定设定了备用传输系统
Tony Stark! He must've built a back-up transmitter.

376
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,780
他为什么要那么做
Why would he do that?

377
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,430
那个人很邪恶  不相信任何人
That man was a villain. Didn't trust anyone.

378
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,710
攻击
Charge!

379
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,570
瓦坎达万岁
Wakanda forever!

380
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,890
瓦坎达万岁
Wakanda forever!

381
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,660
为了特查拉
For T'Challa!

382
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,020
{\an8}无人机上传联系中断

383
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,050
{\an8}斯塔克工业

384
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,320
达到你的预期了吗
Does it meet your expectations?

385
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,720
远超预期
It surpasses them.

386
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,040
我希望我们能将这美景
I wish we could share it

387
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,250
分享给我们全世界的兄弟姐们们
with our brothers and sisters across the world.

388
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,690
你的父亲也曾希望如此
Your father wished the same.

389
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,190
也许这就是为什么芭丝特把你送回我们身边
Perhaps that is why Bast has returned you to us.

390
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:45,520
我是瓦坎达的忠实仆人  陛下
I am a loyal servant of Wakanda, Your Majesty.

391
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,910
请让我效忠
Let me be of service.

392
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,340
喝下心形草
With this herb,

393
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,100
你将成为下一任黑豹
you shall become the next Black Panther.

394
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,650
这一切值得吗
Was it worth it,

395
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,130
我的堂弟
my cousin?

396
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,030
值得  我必须这么做
Yeah. I did what I had to do.

397
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,390
为什么  王位吗
For what? A throne?

398
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,600
为了复仇  为了我的父亲
For vengeance. For my father.

399
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,020
为了所有在全球各地
And for all my brothers and sisters

400
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,220
被欺压的兄弟姐妹们
who suffered through oppression

401
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,170
而不像你这样袖手旁观
while you just sat back and watched.

402
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:34,870
你认为解救人类苦难的良方  是更多的苦难
You believe the cure for human suffering is more suffering.

403
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,750
力量才是良方  现在我拥有了力量
The cure is power. And now, I have it.

404
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,610
因为这是你偷来的
Because you stole it.

405
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:44,090
不应得的能力  将会是很无常的  我的堂弟
Power, unearned, can be a very volatile force, cousin.

406
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,640
它终将冲昏你的头脑
It'll get the best of you, eventually.

407
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,320
对你的  随我们来说  都是如此
On your plane, or on ours.

408
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,960
{\an8}只有你能为斯塔克复仇

409
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,670
驱逐舰已经在非洲海岸巡航
Destroyers are circling the African coast.

410
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,230
六点前把所有耶利哥导弹锁定并装载好
I want all Jericho missiles locked and loaded by 0600.

411
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,700
-是  长官  -无意冒犯  先生
- Yes, sir. - All due respect, sir,

412
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,320
对一个大多美国人地图上找不到的国家来说
isn't that a lot of firepower to aim

413
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,250
火力是不是过于猛烈了
at a country most Americans can't find on a map?

414
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,660
到明天  他们也不需要去地图上找了
By tomorrow, they won't need to.

415
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,920
什么...你怎么进来的
What...How did you get in here?

416
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,070
我来帮忙的  波茨小姐
I'm here to help, Miss Potts.

417
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,570
我就知道  是他杀了托尼
I knew it. He killed Tony.

418
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,120
还杀了你哥哥  你怎么拿到这个的
And your brother? How did you get this?

419
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,620
斯塔克先生是天才  但他并不是唯一的天才
Mr. Stark was a genius, but he's not the only genius.

420
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,690
看起来我们有共同的敌人
It appears we have a common enemy.

421
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,590
很不幸  你和我的阵营都拒绝看到这一点
Unfortunately, your side and mine refuse to see it.

422
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,200
那么  让我们一起帮他们睁开眼睛
So, let us open their eyes together.

423
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,850
英雄从未逝去
Heroes are never really gone.

424
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,330
他们永生
They live forever.

425
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:58,410
就像受到他们鼓舞而继续战斗的人们一样
As do the ones they inspire to carry on the fight.
